<p>--------------------</p>
<p>On March 12th 2019, the World Wide Web turned 30 years old. On Saturday March 12th 1989, the world wide web was created, which completely changed the world.</p>
<p>The Web changed the way we get information, how we act, how society works, how hospitals work, and more. We have all the information in the world right at our fingertips.</p>
<p>We really take the internet for granted. The internet is a great thing that brought us all together and taught us even more on how the world, and even the universe works.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the internet has been around even longer. The internet has been around since the 1950s but it was a lot more private, and only the wealthy and powerful could use it.</p>
<p>The internet has affected our everyday lives. It is such a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>So let's take a little look back on some historic parts of the internet</p>

<H4>Google</H4>
<p>Google played an important role in making the internet easier to use. Google shaped the way the new internet users navigate the inrernet. Google launched in 1998, and quickly rose to become one of the most powerful and famous search engines of all time.</p>

<H4>Flash</H4>
<p>Flash was important in making webpages lightweight. When it was in its prime, it was an important part of the internet. It made it easier to view websites, games, and animations through the internet. Adobe is cutting support for flash next year, because its usage has dropped and is becoming obsolete, as the internet has transitioned to HTML5. Flash used to help the internet be accessible for slower connections.</p>

<H4>YouTube</H4>
<p>It used to be really difficult to share videos with your friends or publish them, YouTube was a game changer. You could upload as you please, upload even if nobody was around to review it for you. You could upload anything you wanted without having to go through corporate executives personally.</p>

<H4>So much more</H4>
<p>There is A LOT more to the internet than these 4 elements. There are exabytes upon exabytes of webpages, videos, images, music, and more.</p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p>The internet has changed a lot since its public adoption in the late 80s, early 90s, and 2000s, but it still serves its purpose of connecting us, helping us access information, and just having fun</p>
